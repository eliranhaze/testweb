	<p class="col-text">I am a Motwani Postdoctoral Fellow in Stanford's Computer Science theory group, hosted by Omer Reingold.</p>

    <p class="col-text">My research lies within Theory of Computation, mainly computational complexity, randomness in computation and explicit constructions. 
	    More specifically, I am interesterd in pseudorandomness, derandomization, and error-correcting codes.</p>
  <p class="col-text">
    Before coming to Stanford, I was a postdoctoral researcher in UT Austin's Algorithms and Computational Theory Group hosted by Dana Moshkovitz and David Zuckerman.  
	  I received my PhD from Tel-Aviv University, where I was fortunate to have Amnon Ta-Shma as my advisor.
